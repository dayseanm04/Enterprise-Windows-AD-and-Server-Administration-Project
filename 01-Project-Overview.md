# 🏢 Enterprise Windows AD & Server Administration Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  

In this project i will be designing, deploying, and administering a **centralized Windows Server 2019 enterprise infrastructure** for a simulated small-to-medium sized organization with approximately **20–25 Windows client computers**.

The environment simulates a real-world business where centralized identity management, secure network services, endpoint control, and administrative automation are required to efficiently manage users, devices, and company resources.

The infrastructure is built using industry-standard Microsoft technologies including:
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- DNS and DHCP  
- Group Policy Management  
- Windows Server Security Features  
- Hyper-V Virtualization  
- Backup and Recovery Solutions  

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate practical Windows Server administration skills and enterprise infrastructure design best practices.

## 💼 Business Justification  

As organizations grow, managing users and computers individually becomes inefficient and increases security risks.  

This project demonstrates how Windows Server 2019 can:

- Increase administrative efficiency  
- Improve overall security posture  
- Standardize user environments  
- Reduce configuration errors  
- Provide centralized control over enterprise resources
